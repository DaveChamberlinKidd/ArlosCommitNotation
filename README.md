# Description
Arlo's Commit Notation is a way of making small commits that show the risk involved in each step. It is particulary useful in legacy systems. 

# Provable Refactorings
If you can get a series of commits that is all lowercase commits, you can deploy without the need for Regression Testing, or lengthy conversations about accepting the pull request to trunk.

A provable refactoring requires the burden of proof. The main methods of proof are
* automated refactoring via tool
* Scripted manual refactoring, using the compiler to verify each step
* Very Highly tested code, with the tests providing proof

# Living Documentation
We invite you to submit pull requests to help evolve this notation and methodology.
